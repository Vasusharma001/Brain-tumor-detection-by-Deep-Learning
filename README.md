# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project utilizes deep learning techniques to detect tumors from medical images. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the model is trained to classify images and assist in early tumor detection, aiding medical professionals in diagnosis.

## Features
- Image classification for tumor detection
- Deep learning model using CNNs
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Performance evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
- Visualization of model predictions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of medical images labeled as either tumor or non-tumor. Proper preprocessing and augmentation techniques have been applied to improve model performance.
